Start the Apache service now that the certificates used comply with the
system-wide crypto policy. Now that the service complies with the
policy, it should start without further issue.

[source,bash,run,subs=attributes+]
----
systemctl restart httpd.service
----

You can verify the Apache service is now running again.

[source,bash,run,subs=attributes+]
----
systemctl status httpd.service --no-pager
----

Now that the service is running and certificates used comply with the
`+FUTURE+` system-wide cryptographic policy, connect to the Apache service
and validate that the new certificate is being offered to client
browsers.

[source,bash,run,subs=attributes+]
----
openssl s_client -connect localhost:443 </dev/null 2>/dev/null | grep '^Server public key'
