To comply with the system-wide cryptographic policy of FUTURE, you will
need to generate a replacement SSL certificate using an RSA key of 3072
bit length, or longer.

Before you create the updated SSL certificate, make a backup of your
existing certificate files.

[source,bash]
----
cp /etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key /etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key.orig
----

[source,bash]
----
cp /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt.orig
----

Now that you have a backup of your original certificates, and could
revert to them if something unexpected happens, generate a new,
replacement SSL certificate and public key. The new RSA certificate will
use a public key of of 3072 bits.

[source,bash]
----
openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:3072 -subj='/C=XX/O=Default' -keyout /etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key -out /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt
----

Verify the bit-length of the key to confirm that it is 3072 bit.

[source,bash]
----
openssl x509 -in /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt -text | grep bit
----

Now that a new SSL certificate has been created using a larger public
key, it complies with the requirements of the FUTURE cryptographic
policy.

____
*NOTE:* It is recommended practice to use Certificate Authority (CA)
issued certificates. If you were using a certificate from a Certificate
Authority, you would need to generate a new Certificate Signature
Request (csr) and submit it to your CA. When you receive the signed
certificate from your CA, you would then position it, and update any
configuration files needed to reference it.
