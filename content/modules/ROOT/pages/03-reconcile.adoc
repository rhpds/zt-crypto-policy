You will need to restart the Apache service after changing the
system-wide crypto policy so that it runs under the new policy.

____
*NOTE:* Red Hat recommends rebooting the system for all services to be
initialized with the new cryptographic policy, however, for this
exercise you will be individually working with the Apache web service.
____

[source,bash]
----
systemctl restart httpd.service
----

The Apache service fails to restart. You can see a more specific error
message in the SSL error log for Apache. You will further diagnose this
using the error messages from the command below and reconcile this in
additional steps in the exercise.

[source,bash]
----
tail -2 /var/log/httpd/ssl_error_log
----

____
*NOTE:* Your log date, time, process ID, or other metadata may be

____

From the log data, the error causing Apache to not start is caused by
the /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt file. Recall from the first step,
Validate the Environment, that this file contained an RSA certificate
that used a 2048 bit public key. However, due to the new FUTURE policy,
RSA certificates now require a public key of at least 3072 bits.

The FUTURE system-wide crypto policy is stopping Apache from starting
because running with the existing certificate, and public key, would
violate the policy settings. In the next steps, you will resolve this
issue.
